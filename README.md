# Hemtenta-4_Fredrik
This was a project during year 4 at NTI Södertörn where we were tasked to create a website to display information for our teacher on a screen outside his office

## Requirements
The requirements for this project was to create 3 pages, the first page would be the landing page that had contact information, an image of the teacher, current weather, current date, a qr-code for booking times and his current availability status.
The second page would be a page that the users are taken to if they were to scan the qr-code, which was a page where they could book a meeting time which was set by the teacher.
The last page is a admin page where the teacher was able to set a time that could be booked, and if they were to book that time it would show on the page where it could be edited by the teacher if needed
